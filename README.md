# XAML Skills Test
This test I made in 2013.

## Task
This image fully describes the task. You need to make only one xaml-file that will look the same as in the picture.
Task will be checked in Kaxaml.

![Task](https://github.com/podolskiy/XAML-Skills-Test/blob/master/test_xaml.jpg?raw=true)

## Solution
XAML-file divided in three parts.
1. So, for data storage in a xaml I've used **XmlDataProvider**, which is provided especially for this purpose.
2. To describe template for list elements, I've used special **DataTemplate** xaml-element.

## Sources
You can download the Kaxaml XAML editor to check how exactly the solution looks on the screen and how it works.
